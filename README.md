# MonsterVault
## Abstract
In an era where effective financial management is paramount yet challenging for many, MonsterVault, an iOS app, revolutionizes financial management by incorporating a virtual pet care system, encouraging expenses and income tracking with features like receipt scanning, object detection, and manual entry. For each recorded tracking, users accumulate points that can be exchanged for pet food, connecting usersâ€™ budgeting actions with the growth of pets. This gamification aspect makes financial management a more engaging and rewarding process, aiming to cultivate lasting financial discipline among users. MonsterVault enhances financial literacy through insights into spending patterns by offering a visual representation of spending habits and budget status. MonsterVault turns the routine task of budget management into an enjoyable activity, fostering financial discipline and literacy uniquely and interactively.
